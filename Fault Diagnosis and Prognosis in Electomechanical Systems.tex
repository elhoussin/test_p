 \maketitle  
 
The energy transition is one of the most important societal challenge of the next decades. This transition relies on a massive increase of renewable sources (wind, solar, ...) in the energy mix and on the introduction of new usages (EV, HEV). Despite its ecological benefits, the energy transition has also raised new technical challenges. First, the balance between energy consumption and production becomes more difficult to maintain due to the use of intermittent energy sources. Then, the power reliability and quality are critically affected by
